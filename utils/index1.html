    <p>JavaScript (JS) exhibits differences in its usage and functionality when employed in front-end and back-end development contexts.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Front-end Development</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>In front-end development, JavaScript is primarily utilized to enhance user interactivity and functionality within web browsers.</li>
        <li>Front-end JavaScript often deals with manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update and modify webpage content without reloading the entire page.</li>
        <li>It is commonly employed in implementing client-side validation, animations, and handling user input.</li>
        <li>Libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js are frequently used in front-end development to facilitate the creation of complex user interfaces and manage state effectively.</li>
        <li>Front-end JavaScript relies heavily on CSS for styling and layout purposes, and it interacts closely with HTML to render content on the user's browser.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Back-end Development</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>In back-end development, JavaScript serves as a server-side scripting language, enabling the creation of dynamic web applications and handling server-side logic.</li>
        <li>Node.js, a popular runtime environment for JavaScript, allows developers to execute JS code on the server-side, enabling full-stack development using a single programming language.</li>
        <li>Back-end JavaScript is utilized for tasks such as handling database operations, managing authentication and authorization, implementing business logic, and serving API endpoints.</li>
        <li>Frameworks like Express.js provide a robust and flexible infrastructure for building scalable back-end systems, allowing developers to define routes, middleware, and handle HTTP requests and responses.</li>
        <li>Unlike front-end JavaScript, back-end JavaScript does not directly interact with the DOM or browser APIs. Instead, it interacts with databases, file systems, and other server resources.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In summary, while front-end JavaScript focuses on enhancing user experience and interactivity within web browsers, back-end JavaScript is used for server-side logic and facilitating the communication between the client-side and server-side components of web applications. Both contexts require a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, but their usage and functionalities differ significantly based on the specific requirements and responsibilities within each development environment.</p>
